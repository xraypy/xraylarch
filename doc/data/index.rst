Reading and Writing Data
============================

Larch has several built-in functions for reading and writing scientific
data.  The intention is that the types and varieties of supported files
will increase.  In addition, because standard Python modules can be used
from Larch, many types of standard data and image types can be used by
importing the appropriate Python module.  This chapter describes the Larch
functions for data handling.

Simple ASCII Column Files
============================

A simple way to store small amounts of numerical data, and one that is
widely used in the XAFS community, is to store data in plaintext (ASCII
encoded) data files, with whitespace delimited numbers layed out as a
table, with a fix number of columns and rows indicated by newlines.
Typically a comment character such as "#" is used to signify header
information.  For instance::

   # room temperature FeO.
   # data from 20-BM, 2001, as part of NXS school
   #------------------------
   #   energy     xmu       i0
     6911.7671  -0.35992590E-01  280101.00
     6916.8730  -0.39081634E-01  278863.00
     6921.7030  -0.42193483E-01  278149.00
     6926.8344  -0.45165576E-01  277292.00
     6931.7399  -0.47365589E-01  265707.00

This file and others like it can be read with the builtin
:func:`read_ascii` function.

.. function:: read_ascii(filename, comentchar='#;*%', labels=None)

   opens and read an plaintext data file, returning a new group containing
   the data.


   :param filename:  name of file to read.
   :type  filename:  string
   :param commentchar:  string of valid comment characters
   :type  commentchar:  string
   :param labels:  string to split for column labels
   :type labels:  string, ``None``, or ``False``

    The commentchar argument (#;% by default) sets the valid comment characters:
    if the first character in a line matches one of these, the line is marked
    as a  header lines.

    Header lines continue until a line with '#----' (that is, any
    commentchar followed by 4 '-' The line immediately following that is
    read as column labels (space delimited)

    If the header is of the form::

       # KEY : VAL   (ie commentchar key ':' value)

    these key-value pairs (all as strings) will be parsed into an 'attributes' sub-group.

    If labels has the default value ``None``, column labels from the line
    following the line of '#----' (if available) will be used.

    If labels is ``False``, the group will have a *data* variable contain
    the 2-dimensional data.

Some examples of :func:`read_ascii`::

    larch> g = read_ascii('mydata.dat')
    larch> show(g)
    == Group ascii_file mydata.dat: 6 symbols ==
      attributes: <Group header attributes from mydata.dat>
      column_labels: ['energy', 'xmu', 'i0']
      energy: array<shape=(412,), type=dtype('float64')>
      filename: 'mydata.dat'
      i0: array<shape=(412,), type=dtype('float64')>
      xmu: array<shape=(412,), type=dtype('float64')>
    larch>

which reads the data file and sets array names according to the column
labels in the file.   You can be explicit::

    larch> g = read_ascii('mydata.dat', label='e mutrans monitor')
    larch> show(g)
    == Group ascii_file mydata.dat: 6 symbols ==
      attributes: <Group header attributes from mydata.dat>
      column_labels: ['e', 'mutrans', 'monitor']
      e: array<shape=(412,), type=dtype('float64')>
      filename: 'mydata.dat'
      monitor: array<shape=(412,), type=dtype('float64')>
      mutrans: array<shape=(412,), type=dtype('float64')>
    larch>

and to get the data as a 2-D array::

    larch> g  = read_ascii('mydata.dat', labels=False)
    larch> show(g)
    == Group ascii_file mydata.dat: 4 symbols ==
      attributes: <Group header attributes from mydata.dat>
      column_labels: []
      data: array<shape=(3, 412), type=dtype('float64')>
      filename: 'mydata.dat'
   larch>


.. function:: write_ascii(filename, *args, commentchar='#', label=None, header=None)

   opens and writes arrays, scalars, and text to an ASCII file.


   :param commentchar: character for comment ('#')
   :param  label:      array label line (autogenerated)
   :param   header:    array of strings for header


.. function::  write_group(filename, group, scalars=None, arrays=None, arrays_like=None,  commentchar='#')

   write data from a specified group to an ASCII data file.
   This is pretty minimal and may work poorly for large groups of complex
   data.


Using HDF5 Files
========================


HDF5 is an increasingly popular data format for scientific data, as it can
efficiently hold very large arrays in a heirarchical format that holds
"metadata" about the data, and can be explored with a variety of tools.
The interface used in Larch is based on `h5py`_, which should be consulted
for further documentation.

.. function:: h5_group(filename)

    opens and maps and HDF5 file to a Larch Group, with HDF5 Groups map as
    Larch Groups.  Note that the full set of data is not read and
    copied. Instead, the HDF5 file is kept open and data accessed from the
    file as needed.

An example using :func:`h5_group` shows that one can browse through the
data heirarchy of the HDF5 file, and pick out the needed data::

    larch> g = h5group('test.h5')
    larch> show(g)
    == Group test.h5: 3 symbols ==
      attrs: {u'Collection Time': ': Sat Feb 4 13:29:00 2012', u'Version': '1.0.0',
              u'Beamline': 'GSECARS, 13-IDC / APS', u'Title': 'Epics Scan Data'}
      data: <Group test.h5/data>
      h5_file: <HDF5 file "test.h5" (mode r)>
    larch>show(g.data)
    == Group test.h5/data: 5 symbols ==
      attrs: {u'scan_prefix': '13IDC:', u'start_time': ': Sat Feb 4 13:29:00 2012',
            u'correct_deadtime': 'True', u'dimension': 2,
            u'stop_time': ': Sat Feb 4 13:44:52 2009'}
      environ: <Group test.h5/data/environ>
      full_xrf: <Group test.h5/data/full_xrf>
      merged_xrf: <Group test.h5/data/merged_xrf>
      scan: <Group test.h5/data/scan>


    larch> g.data.scan.sums
    <HDF5 dataset "det": shape (15, 26, 26), type "<f8">

    larch> imshow(g.data.scan.sums[8:,:,:])

This interface is general-purpose but somewhat low-level.  As HDF5 formats
and schemas become standardized, better interfaces can easily be made on
top of this approach.


Reading NetCDF Files
============================

NetCDF4 is an older and less flexible file format than HDF5, but is
efficient for storing array data and still in wide use.

.. function:: netcdf_group(filename)

  returns a group with data from a NetCDF4 file.

.. function:: netcdf_file(filename, mode='r')

  opens and returns a netcdf file.


Reading TIFF Images
============================

TIFF is a popular image format used by many cameras and detectors. The
interface used in Larch is based on code from Chrisoph Gohlke.

.. function:: read_tiff(fname)

   reads a TIFF image from a TIFF File.  This returns just the image data as an
   array, and does return any metadata.

.. function:: tiff_object(fname)

   opens and returns a TIFF file.  This is useful for extracting metadata
   and multiple series.


Working with Epics Channel Access
===================================

Many synchrotron facilities use the Epics control system.  If the Epics
Channel Access layer, which requires network access and configuration
discussed elsewhere, are set correcty, then Larch can read and write data
from Epics Process Variables (PVs).  The interface used in Larch is based
on `pyepics`_, which should be consulted for further documentation. The
access is encapsulated into three functions:

.. function:: caget(PV_name, as_string=False)

   get the value of the Process Variable.  The optional ``as_string``
   argument ensures the returned value is the string representation for the
   variable.

.. function:: caput(PV_name, value, wait=False)

   set the value of the Process Variable.  If the optional ``wait`` is
   ``True``, the function will not return until the put "completes". For
   some types of data, this may wait for some process (moving a motor,
   triggering a detector) to finish before returning.

.. function:: PV(PV_name)

   create and return an Epics PV object for a Process Variable.  This will
   have get() and put() methods, and allows you to add callback functions
   which will be run with new values everytime the PV value changes.

Reading Scan Data from APS Beamlines
===========================================

This list is minimal, but can be expanded easily to accomodate more
facilities and beamlines.

.. function:: read_mda(filename, maxdim=4)

   read a binary MDA (multi-Dimensional Array) file from the Epics SScan
   Record, and return a group based on the scans it contains.  This is not
   very well tested -- use with caution!

.. function:: read_gsescan(filename)

   read a (old-style) GSECARS Escan data file into a group.

.. function:: read_stepscan(filename)

   read a GSECARS StepScan data file into a group.


Reading XAFS Data Interchange (XDI) Files
=============================================

The X-ray Data Interchange Format has been developed as part of an effort
to standardize the format of XAFS data files (see `xdi`_.)

.. function:: read_xdi(filename)

   read an XDI data file into a Larch group.


Saving and Restoring Larch Groups
=========================================

It is often useful to save groups of data and be able to open them again
later.  The :func:`save` / :func:`restore` mechanism here allows you to
save the state of a number of Larch groups and use them in another session.

Some precautions should be kept in mind, as not all Larch data is easily
transferrable.  Most importantly, Python functions cannot be saved to any
sort of data that can be recovered in a meaningful way.  This is actually
not as big of a problem as you might expect: you want to save **data**, and
the functions will be present in the later session.  All the built-in Larch
groups and data structures can be saved and restored.

.. function:: save(filename, list_of_groups)

    save a set of Larch groups and data into an HDF5 file.


.. function:: restore(filename, group=None)

    recover groups from a Larch 'save' file.  If ``group`` is None, the
    groups in the save file will be returned (in the order in which they
    were saved).  If ``group`` is an existing Larch group, the groups in
    the save file will be put inside that group, and will not be returned.
